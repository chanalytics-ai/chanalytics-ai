### Hello!👋 Welcome to my Github! 

My name is William Chan. I'm an Insights and Analytics Nerd 🤓 from Montreal, Canada 🇨🇦 - the most multicultural Canadian city & best food all around. I absolutely love data and joined the field in 2013 right before the mainstream boom. I've been dabbling in the analytics space ever since. I'm particularly interested in Customer Analytics and Sports Analytics. Most of my projects and articles on [Medium](https://chanalytics-ai.medium.com/) will be around those topics. 

I spent 10 years involved in sports before pivoting to business 📊. I'm grateful for the incredible experiences I've had with FIFA ⚽️, Hockey Canada 🏒, IIHF, and various amateur soccer associations in Canada. Following my early sports career, I graduated with a Bachelor's in Business Technology and Data from Concordia University. I landed a role at Air Canada ✈️ where I built out their analytics program in their Global Sales department. Seeing the impact data could have on a business's performance I decided to dive deeper by completing my Master of Management Analytics at Queen's University. I also joined Merck Canada 💊 with a mandate to build out their analytics function.

Armed with an understanding of the business world coupled with my technical abilities, my ultimate goal is to use what I've learned and apply it to the sports world.

I love travelling and experiencing different cultures (and their food). During my time at Air Canada, I was fortunate enough to visit many countries including: Japan 🇯🇵, Australia 🇦🇺, Singapore 🇸🇬, France 🇫🇷, UK 🇬🇧, Spain 🇪🇸, Germany 🇩🇪, and Belgium 🇧🇪. I speak English, French, and Cantonese 🇭🇰 (I was born in Hong Kong) and eager to learn Italian 🇮🇹.

When I'm not on my computer, I'm either travelling 🏝, playing video games 🕹, or golfing ⛳️!

I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chanalytics/) if you share an interest in any of the topics I mentioned.

All the best.
Will
